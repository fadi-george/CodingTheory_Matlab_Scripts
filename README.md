# CodingTheory_Matlab_Scripts

Old project containing MATLAB scripts designed to help with excerises for the book "Coding Theory and Cryptography".

Contains helpful scripts that can help generate an IMLD table, determine the most likely codeword for a set of codewords, do polynomial division for two binary polynomials, find the closest square for some number, etc.
